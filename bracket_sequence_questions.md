# Answer the questions


Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]] 


## Can this sequence be considered correct?

No, this bracket sequence is incorrect.

## If the answer to the previous question is “no”, then what needs to be changed in it to make it correct?

I highlighted the inconsistent brackets in the system below:
[ `(` (()) () (()) `]` ]

Each opening bracket should have a corresponding closing bracket.

As for the solution, there may be several ways to fix it as it's not entirely clear what the intended meaning is. So the answer would be to either remove the extra brackets, add the corresponding brackets to the pairs, switch the type of brackets to form a pair if a wrong type of bracket was used.

### Option 1. Switching the bracket types:

1. [((())()(()))]
2. [[(())()(())]]

### Option 2. Removing extra brackets:

3. [(())()(())]

### Option 3. Adding missing brackets:

4. [[((()))()(())]]
5. [[((())())(())]]
6. [[((())()(()))]]
